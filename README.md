# reset_USB_port
I recently bought an iCON iKEyboard 8x - link below - Sometimes it only produces sound when releasing the key, the sound corresponds to the speed/force I hit the key with, though.

I figured I have to "reset" the given port, I noticed that keyboard stays powered on during the 1 sec while it's not "managed" and then it works correctly. Please provide feedback if you use this script.

I tried with a wireless Lenovo mouse, works with that too, I suppose I could be more careful with the asterisk in the /sys... path, but meeh, works fine for my current system, your experience may differ :D
